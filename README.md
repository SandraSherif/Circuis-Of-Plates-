# Circuis-Of-Plates-
It's a funny game. Scenario: The Player Chooses One of the three difficulties. The Timer Starts. Depending on the Difficulty chosen the shapes begin to fall with a specific speed and the player can control the clown using left and right keys. The Player starts collecting the falling shapes on the two sticks that the clown is holding. If the player collects three consecutive shapes on the same stick of the same colour they vanish and the score is increased. If the player collects a Star shape the score is saved. If the player collects a bomb his score is restored to the last saved score and if there were'nt any score saved (he hasn't collected a star before the bomb) the score becomes zero. When the timer reaches 60 seconds the game stops.
